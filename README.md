## What is CreatureChat Evolved?
**CreatureChat Evolved** is a Minecraft mod that lets you chat with any creature in the game using AI. With built-in [Player2](https://player2.game/) integration, creatures can speak, remember past interactions, and react dynamically to your actions â€” no extra setup required. 

## Features
- **No LLM/API Setup:** All you need is the [Player2 App](https://player2.game/), no need to set up your own API account.
- **Behaviors:** Creatures can make decisions on their own and **Follow, Flee, Attack, Protect**, and more!
- **Reactions:** Creatures automatically react to being damaged or receiving items from players.
- **Friendship:** Track your relationships from friends to foes.
- **Multi-Player:** Share the experience; conversations sync across server & players.
- **Memory:** Creatures remember your past interactions, making each chat more personal.

# Custom API (Optional)
If you prefer to configure your own LLM, and do not want to use the Player2 App, you can follow these instructions:

CreatureChat **requires** an AI / LLM (large language model) to generate text (characters and chat). There are many different
options for connecting an LLM. 

1. **Free & Local**: Use open-source and free-to-use LLMs without any API fees. [**Difficulty: Hard**]
2. **Bring Your Own Key**: Use your own API key from providers like OpenAI or Groq. [**Difficulty: Medium**]
3. **Token Shop**: Supports CreatureChat by purchasing tokens from the CreatureChat original developers on Discord [This is not part of player2]. [**Difficulty: Easy**]

### 1. Free & Local
CreatureChat fully supports **free and open-source** LLMs. To get started:

- An HTTP endpoint compatible with the OpenAI Chat Completion JSON syntax is required. We highly recommend using:
  - [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) & [LiteLLM](https://litellm.vercel.app/) as your HTTP proxy.
  - **LiteLLM Features:**
    - Supports over **100+ LLMs** (e.g., Anthropic, VertexAI, HuggingFace, Google Gemini, and Ollama).
    - Proxies them through a local HTTP endpoint compatible with CreatureChat.
    - **Note:** Running a local LLM on your computer requires a powerful GPU.
  - Set the local HTTP endpoint in-game:
    - `/creaturechat url set "http://ENTER-YOUR-HTTP-ENDPOINT-FROM-LITE-LLM"`
    - `/creaturechat model set ENTER-MODEL-NAME`
    - `/creaturechat timeout set 360`
  - Additional help can be found in the **#locall-llm-info** channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/m9dvPFmN3e).

### 2. Bring Your Own Key
For those already using a third-party API (e.g., OpenAI, Groq):

- Integrate your own API key for seamless connectivity.
- Costs depend on the providerâ€™s usage-based pricing model.
- By default, CreatureChat uses the OpenAI endpoint and `gpt-3.5-turbo` model, known for its balance of low cost and fast performance.
- Be aware that OpenAIâ€™s developer API does not include free usage. Please review the [OpenAI pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for detailed information.
- To create an OpenAI API key, visit [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), and use the **+ Create new secret key** button.
- Set the API key & model in-game:
  - `/creaturechat key set <YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE>`
  - `/creaturechat model set gpt-3.5-turbo`

### 3. Token Shop
Supports CreatureChat by purchasing tokens from the original developers [Not player2 affiliated]:

- Easy setup with simple token packs, created for CreatureChat users.
- More info is available in the #token-shop channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/m9dvPFmN3e).
- Set the token-shop API key in-game:
  - `/creaturechat key set <YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE>`
