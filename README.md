## Commands
The CreatureChat mod allows users to configure settings via in-game commands. Here's how to use them:

### Command Usage
- `/creaturechat key set <key>`
  Sets the **OpenAI API key**. This is required for making requests to the LLM.
- `/creaturechat url set <url>`
  **OPTIONAL:** Sets the URL of the API used to make LLM requests.
- `/creaturechat model set <model>`
  **OPTIONAL:** Sets the model used for generating responses in chats.

### Configuration Scope:
  You can specify the **optional** configuration scope at the end of each command to determine where settings should be applied:

- **Default** Configuration (`--config default`):
  Applies the configuration universally, unless overridden by a server-specific configuration.
- **Server**-Specific Configuration (`--config server`):
  Applies the configuration only to the server where the command is executed.
- If the `--config` option is not specified, the `default` configuration scope is assumed.

## Costs Associated with Third-Party LLM APIs
Using third-party Large Language Model (LLM) APIs, such as OpenAI, will incur usage-based fees. 
These fees are typically based on the amount of data processed or the number of requests made 
to the service. Before integrating or using these APIs, please review the pricing details 
provided by the API provider. Be aware of the potential costs and plan your usage accordingly 
to avoid unexpected charges.

By using this software and integrating third-party APIs, you acknowledge and agree to take 
full responsibility for securing your API keys and managing API usage within the terms and 
cost structures outlined by the providers.

## API Key Confidentiality
Always keep your API keys confidential to prevent unauthorized access and potential misuse.
Exposing your API key publicly can lead to security risks, unauthorized usage, and potential
service abuse. Treat your API keys as sensitive information and only share them with trusted
parties within secure environments.
