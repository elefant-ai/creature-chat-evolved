## Installation
1. **Install Fabric Loader**: Follow the instructions [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/).
2. **Download Fabric API**: Get the version which we support (refer to `gradle.properties` for supported Minecraft and Fabric versions)
   from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
   or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).
3. **Install CreatureChat Mod**: Place `creaturechat-*.jar` and `fabric-api-*.jar` into your `.minecraft/mods`
   folder.

## Commands
The CreatureChat mod allows users to configure settings via in-game commands. Here's how to use them:

### Command Usage
- `/creaturechat key set <key>`
  Sets the **OpenAI API key**. This is required for making requests to the LLM.
- `/creaturechat url set <url>`
  **Optional:** Sets the URL of the API used to make LLM requests.
- `/creaturechat model set <model>`
  **Optional:** Sets the model used for generating responses in chats.

### Configuration Scope:
  You can specify the **optional** configuration scope at the end of each command to determine where settings should be applied:

- **Default** Configuration (`--config default`):
  Applies the configuration universally, unless overridden by a server-specific configuration.
- **Server**-Specific Configuration (`--config server`):
  Applies the configuration only to the server where the command is executed.
- If the `--config` option is not specified, the `default` configuration scope is assumed.

be updated. Below are the general steps for this upgrade process.

2. Copy/paste the recommended versions into `gradle.properties`
3. **Optional:** Update the Loom version in `build.gradle` 
4. Re-build: `./gradlew build` and watch for any errors
5. Re-run: `./gradlew runClient`
6. **Optional:** Re-start **IntelliJ IDEA** to clear cached gradle
