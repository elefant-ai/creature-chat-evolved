## Installation
1. **Install Fabric Loader & API**: Follow the instructions [here](https://fabricmc.net/use/).
1. **Install CreatureChat Mod**: Download and copy `creaturechat-*.jar` and `fabric-api-*.jar` into your `.minecraft/mods`
   folder.
1. **Create an OpenAI API key**: Visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys, and use the **+ Create new secret key** button.
   Copy/Paste your key into the `/creaturechat key set <YOUR-SECRET-KEY-HERE>` command.

## Commands
The CreatureChat mod allows users to configure settings via in-game commands. Here's how to use them:

### Command Usage
- **REQUIRED:** `/creaturechat key set <key>`
  - Sets the *OpenAI API key*. This is required for making requests to the LLM.
- **OPTIONAL:** `/creaturechat url set <url>`
  - Sets the URL of the API used to make LLM requests. Defaults to `"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"`
- **OPTIONAL:** `/creaturechat model set <model>`
  - Sets the model used for generating responses in chats. Defaults to `gpt-3.5-turbo`.

### Configuration Scope:
**OPTIONAL:** You can specify the configuration scope at the end of each command to determine where settings should be applied:

- **Default** Configuration (`--config default`):
  Applies the configuration universally, unless overridden by a server-specific configuration.
- **Server**-Specific Configuration (`--config server`):
  Applies the configuration only to the server where the command is executed.
- If the `--config` option is not specified, the `default` configuration scope is assumed.

## Costs & Security
Using third-party Large Language Model (LLM) APIs, such as OpenAI, will incur usage-based **fees**.
These fees are based on the amount of data processed. Before integrating your API key, please
[review the pricing](https://openai.com/pricing#language-models) details provided by the API provider.
Be aware of the **potential costs** and plan your usage accordingly to avoid unexpected charges.

## Does OpenAI offer a **FREE** model?
While ChatGPT is a popular product and does offer a free version to their users on their website,
the OpenAI developer API does not extend any free models or free usage. You will be charged for each token
consumed and generated. We use the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model by default, due to its extremely low cost
and fast performance... however it is not free.
