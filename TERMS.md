# Terms of Service for CreatureChat™

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By purchasing a Key to the CreatureChat™ API or using the creaturechat.com API URL, you agree to be bound by these 
terms and conditions ("Terms"). Users utilizing their own OpenAI keys or CreatureChat™ keys must adhere to the 
[OpenAI Terms of Use](https://openai.com/terms/). If you do not agree to all of these Terms, do not use or 
access the CreatureChat™ services.

## 2. Description of Service
CreatureChat™ is a Minecraft mod, owned and operated by owlmaddie, LLC, a Texas-based company. The mod enhances 
gameplay by enabling creatures within Minecraft to respond using natural language processing capabilities. 
This service leverages OpenAI's APIs, among potentially other LLM providers, to enable these capabilities. 
**CreatureChat™ is not affiliated with or endorsed by Minecraft, Microsoft, or Mojang.**

## 3. Use of Service
- You agree not to misuse the CreatureChat™ services provided through creaturechat.com. Misuse includes, but is not limited to, attempting to break the language model, generating harmful or offensive content, or manipulating prompts to cause malfunction.

## 3A. AI-Generated Content
CreatureChat™ relies on third-party language models that generate text autonomously. Although we apply safety filters, 
outputs may at times be inaccurate, offensive, or unlawful. **You are solely responsible** for any content produced 
through your use of CreatureChat™ and agree that owlmaddie LLC shall not be liable for such content.

## 4. Eligibility
