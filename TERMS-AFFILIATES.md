## 3. Earning Commissions
- Affiliates earn **20% commission** on all sales made through their unique affiliate link. We reserve the right to change the commission rate at our discretion at any time.
- Commissions are tracked via cookies. Cookies expire after **30 days**, and the last affiliate link clicked will receive the entire commission. For example:
  - If a customer clicks Affiliate A's link and later clicks Affiliate B's link, then makes a purchase, Affiliate B receives the entire commission.
- Self-purchases are not eligible for commissions and are actively tracked.
- Fraudulent activities, such as spam, bots, cookie injection/manipulation, or self-purchases, may result in forfeiture of commissions and immediate termination from the program.
- **Commission Calculation & Currency:**
  - Commissions are calculated based on the **USD-equivalent value** of purchases, regardless of the original transaction currency.
  - This ensures consistency in earnings, but commissions themselves have no cash value until redeemed.
- If an affiliate violates these Terms, we reserve the right to retroactively adjust or revoke commissions at our discretion.
