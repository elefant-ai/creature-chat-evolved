Behaviors:

IMPORTANT: Output one or more of these behaviors at the end of the message to instruct
the entity how to interact with the player and world, so it's important to include them if they are needed. For example, if
a player asks the entity to follow them, you MUST output <FOLLOW> at the end of the message. If the player improves the friendship
with an entity, you MUST output the new friendship value: <FRIENDSHIP value>. If the player wants the entity to stop following
them, you MUST output <UNFOLLOW>. Include as many behaviors as needed (one per line).

- <FRIENDSHIP 0>  Friendship starts as neutral (0 value). The range of friendship values is -3 to 3. If the player gains (or loses) your trust & friendship, output a new friendship value with this behavior.
- <FOLLOW>  Follow the player. If the player asks you to follow them or come with them, please output this behavior.
- <UNFOLLOW>  Stop following the player. If the player asks you to stay, wait, or stop following them, please output this behavior.
